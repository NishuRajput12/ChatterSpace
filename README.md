# 🧵 ChatterSpace – Reimagining Modern Community Conversations

Welcome to **ChatterSpace** — our mission is to build a **modern, open-source, Discord-like experience** tailored for community-driven platforms, remote collaboration, and knowledge-sharing spaces.  
We’re developing a **scalable, modular, and real-time conversations platform** that can be integrated directly into other applications or run as a standalone service.

## 🧠 Goal

Our objective is to design and develop a fully functional **real-time chat & discussions system** that goes beyond traditional apps like Discord.  
This feature will support structured conversations, threading, roles & permissions, moderation tools, and seamless integration with other app modules — not only via APIs but also via direct code embedding.

## 📦 High-Level Features

- **Channels & Threads** (text-based)
- **Markdown + Code Snippet Support**
- **Threaded Replies**
- **Mentions & Notifications**
- **Real-time Messaging** (Socket.io/WebSockets)
- **Moderation & Permissions**
- **Community-Specific Rooms**
- **File & Image Sharing**
- **Message Reactions & Polls**
- **Light/Dark Mode**
- **Mobile & Desktop Responsiveness**
- **Integratable via API or Direct Code Modules**
